This package provides an implementation of Donald Knuth's Dancing
Links algorithm for solving exact set cover problems.

1.0.4: Minor Python 3 bugfix.
1.0.3: Attempt to make code compatible with Python 3.
1.0.2: Removed extraneous code (had switched from callbacks for solutions to
       making solve a generator to yield, but had forgotten to remove the
       solution callback function parameter from the solve method).
1.0.1: Critical bugfix (N array was one short: did not account for header).
1.0.0: Initial release.
